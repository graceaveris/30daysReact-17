**Day Seventeen - 30 days of React challenge - Random Colour Scheme Picker**

A rehash of an earlier project, create a random color scheme to explore nested components.

**Concepts Explored:**
- Nesting Components
- Handling a stateful child component

Follow me as I self-learn React.js. Each day for thirty days i'll be creating a simple app and posting about it, (attempting to) explain my code, and discuss what I have learned. By the end of day 30 I hope to have a basic working knowledge of React.js and its applications!
